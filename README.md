# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices in California based on features like location, number of rooms, and population. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's California Housing Dataset.

## 📊 Dataset Features

- `longitude`, `latitude`
- `housing_median_age`
- `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`
- `population`, `households`
- `median_income`
- `ocean_proximity` (categorical)
- `median_house_value` (target)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 ML Workflow

1. Data Cleaning (handling missing values)
2. Feature Selection (numeric + categorical)
3. Preprocessing Pipeline
4. Train/Test Split
5. Model Training (Linear Regression)
6. Evaluation (MSE, R² Score)

## 🚀 Results

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** ~4.9 billion
- **R² Score:** ~0.62 (62% variance explained)

## 📂 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files
2. Ensure Python is installed
3. Install required packages:
    ```
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```
4. Make sure the dataset file is named `california_housing.csv` and placed in the same folder.
5. Run the Python script:
    ```
    python california_housing_model.py
    ```
